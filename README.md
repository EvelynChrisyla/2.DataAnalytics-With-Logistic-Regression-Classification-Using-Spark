# 2.DataAnalytics-With-Logistic-Regression-Classification-Using-Spark.ipynb

Data analytics using the Logistic Regression algorithm is used to predict whether someone may experience depression or not based on data on selected factors such as (Gender, Education Level, Married Status, and Salary Income).

so that with this we can understand how these factors influence the probability of someone experiencing depression based on the prediction results of the model mentioned.

There are 2 data sets here, namely Classification_Train which is useful for training and creating prediction models, and Classification_Test which is useful as testing material for the prediction models that have been created.
